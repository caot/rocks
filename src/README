CVS TREE HAS CHANGED

Everything is now a Roll and in the roll directory.  The old rocks,
ganglia, and contrib directories are now empty.  To make your cvs updates
simple you should always update with the following command:

	# cvs update -dP
	
This will create all new directories ('-d') and will then prune the old 
empty ones ('-P').
